# Todo List
## simple todo list
###### I made the todo list in two ways: one with pure javascript and the user can drag the item into the field he want, <br/>
###### the other way i used Ecma script 6. <br/>
###### both of them store the data into the local storage so the user doesn't lose it if he closed the page.
